Machine Learning Project

A-Chatbot for Health is a Healthcare Domain Chatbot to simulate the predictions of a General Physician.

## :page_with_curl: Brief
One can communicate with a chatbot via a text or speech interface and receive responses from artificial intelligence.

A chatbot will often converse with a live human.

Chatbots are utilised in applications including customer assistance for online retailers, call centres, and online gaming.



Chatbots are computer programmes designed to respond to messages automatically. Chatbots can be configured to react consistently, differently in response to messages containing particular keywords, or even to employ machine learning to modify their responses based on the context.

Online chatbots for human services are currently used by an increasing number of hospitals, nursing homes, and even private centres on their websites. These bots interact with potential patients who are browsing the website, assisting them in finding specialists, scheduling appointments, and gaining access to the best care possible.

In any case, people continue to have concerns about the use of artificial intelligence in a field where people's lives may be at risk. It raises the question of whether the aforementioned task should be given to human employees. This healthcare chatbot system provides both in-depth and generic answers, enabling hospitals to offer healthcare support online twenty-four hours a day. Additionally, it aids in lead generation and instantly sends sales information about leads. It aids patients by leading them toward what they are specifically seeking for by asking the questions in a series.
